                        <p>
                            Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is a framework for building service-oriented
                            applications. Using WCF, you can send data as asynchronous messages from one service
                            endpoint to another. A service endpoint can be part of a continuously available service
                            hosted by IIS, or it can be a service hosted in an application. An endpoint can be a client
                            of a service that requests data from a service endpoint. The messages can be as simple as a
                            single character or word sent as XML, or as complex as a stream of binary data.

                        </header>
                        <p>
                            WCF is a flexible platform. Because of this extreme flexibility, WCF is also used in
                            several other Microsoft products. By understanding the basics of WCF, you have an immediate
                            advantage if you also use any of these products.

                            The first technology to pair with WCF was the Windows Workflow Foundation (WF).
                            Workflows simplify application development by encapsulating steps in the workflow as
                            “activities.” In the first version of Windows Workflow Foundation, a developer had to create
                            a host for the workflow. The next version of Windows Workflow Foundation was integrated with
                            WCF. That allowed any workflow to be easily hosted in a WCF service; you can do this by
                            automatically choosing the WF/WCF a project type in Visual Studio 2012.
